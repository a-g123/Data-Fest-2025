Legal Sector Leasing and Sublet Trends: Market Recovery and Shifts Project Overview Legal Sector Leasing and Sublet Trends is a research project analyzing how the legal industry's commercial real estate activity has evolved in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. It focuses on leasing and sublet patterns, building class preferences, geographic shifts, and macroeconomic correlations‚Äîsupported by visualizations that make complex data trends accessible and actionable.

Key Findings Post-COVID Recovery: Leased square footage fell sharply in 2020 but rebounded steadily, peaking at 4.4 million sq ft in 2024.

Class A Dominance: Legal firms heavily favor Class A buildings, though Class O rents have risen above Class A rates since 2022, likely due to location-based demand and misclassified renovations.

Urban Preference: CBDs (Central Business Districts) remain strongholds for legal leasing, with Manhattan leading the market by a wide margin.

Sublet Trends: Sublet availability peaked at 19% in 2021, driven by pandemic disruptions, and fell to 15.5% by late 2024, suggesting stabilization in office demand.

Industry Comparisons: Legal sector sublet activity is low compared to Financial Services and Technology, indicating consistent space needs.

Economic Insights: Sublet trends correlate strongly with GDP (r = 0.949) and inversely with unemployment (r = -0.389), showing their use as tools for economic flexibility.
